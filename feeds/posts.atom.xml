&lt;p&gt;First of all, a bit of housekeeping is in order. There will be a few changes
to the schedule of the San Diego Python monthly meetup for the next two months.
Our usual 4th Thursday schedule would mean a meetup on Thanksgiving and on
Christmas. Instead, we will be having our Django One-Day Unconference on
&lt;strong&gt;November 15&lt;/strong&gt; and a casual meetup on &lt;strong&gt;December 12&lt;/strong&gt;. Neither of these are

&lt;p&gt;Amaziningly, we have one speaker already lined up for this month's San Diego
Python &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/163679382/"&gt;monthly meetup&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you'd be willing to give
a 15 minute talk on a Python related topic this month or next, please let us

Carol and San Diego Python members started a Saturday study group that focuses
on learning Python in a collaborative environment. The group is informal and a
place for members to learn Python, explore web development and scientific
computing packages and tools. Each week has a suggested topic for discussion.
This week's topic will be web development with Flask and Pelican. Feel free to
join us if you are interested in the discussion topic or want to collaborate
with other developers. Beginners and beyond are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/163679382/"&gt;Monthly meetup&lt;/a&gt; (meetup.com) &lt;br /&gt;

in months but a grand total of four people including the organizer and host
attended. Since the previous organizer Ted left for silicon valley, the group
had become smaller and the meetups less frequent. Kendall, Bob, Michael and I
chatted a bit about the state of tech in San Diego and what we should do about
the group. Should we fold it up or try to jump start it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because another San Diego Python group had lost steam we decided to consolidate
the Django group into a more generic Python meetup. The bulk of the credit goes
to Kendall who really took it upon himself to rebuild the group. He bought a
meetup.com subscription, got the credentials to manage the mailing list and
twitter account and organized the February meeting. All I had to do was give the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/davidfischer/Securing-Your-Django-Site-Presentation"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;.
Given the turnout of the previous month, we were expecting a pretty
modest turnout. We were surprised to fill the big room at Co-Merge with forty
people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that first success, we have been organzing regular meetups for the past
year. Having a speaker lined up along with a little upfront marketing on twitter
and meetup.com goes a long way. San Diego Python has organized three workshops
for people learning Python and Django and had all of them sponsored by local
companies or the Python Software Foundation. We have another two lined up too.
We had about thirty people last night for our regular meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had lots of help. The other two Davids, Bharad, Trey, Paul, Kim and
many others have been awesome. Our sponsors -- Cuker and Brightscope -- really
care about the San Diego tech scene and have been tremendous in supporting us.
The Ansir Innovation Center and Co-Merge have been extremely generous letting us
host our events at their locations. Most of all though, the attendees have been
fantastic. I know for a fact that a few people have landed great jobs because
of San Diego Python. Hopefully the next year is just as good as this one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>January 2013 Meetup</title><link href="http://pythonsd.org/january-2013-meetup.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Trey Hunner</name></author><id>tag:pythonsd.org,2013-01-24:january-2013-meetup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Fischer presented on Python modules (PyPI, pip, and virtualenv) and Trey Hunner presented on &lt;a href="https://github.com/pythonsd/presentations/tree/2013-01-24-pdb/import%20pdb%3B%20pdb.set_trace()"&gt;pdb (The Python Debugger)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="regular-meetup"></category><category term="social"></category></entry><entry><title>Intro to Python Workshop</title><link href="http://pythonsd.org/january-2013-intro-to-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:pythonsd.org,2013-01-19:january-2013-intro-to-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/2013-01-19_intro-to-python.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have hats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually we have anything you can think of with our logo on it. I had our
logo embroidery digitized (whatever that means) and it can be embroidered
on just about anything. Just head down to Bowlers Depot (37th and El Cajon)
and mention San Diego Python. You can show your love of Python to the world
and represent San Diego at the same time. You can bring your own bag, hat,
hoodie or polo or you can order something there with the logo on it. The
embroidery itself is about $8 so a nice flexfit Port Authority cap like
this costs a little under $20 all told. My head apparently is huge
so I got the L/XL. I think it looks better on white than black. Feel free
to change up the colors too. I think it would look good in pink!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego Python does not make any money from this. It just gets our name
out and spreads the Python love. If you want to do something else with our
logo, high quality versions are on
